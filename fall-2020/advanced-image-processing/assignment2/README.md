## Specifications:

## TODO
- [?] OpenCV problem

``` Python
from PIL import Image
img = Image.open('image.png').convert('LA')
img.save('greyscale.png')
```
This is probably a solution

- [ ] Test all code
- [ ] Modify variable names
- [ ] Add comments
- [ ] Generate images
- [ ] Try new images from Berkeley dataset
- [ ] Analise the results
- [ ] Prepare report 

### Discussions:
 
1. Analyze result images from three different implementation 
2. What are effects of sigma to images?
3. Does Canny Edge Detector achieve the three goals?
